/*
The while Loopï»¿
1. Recreate the challenge from the lecture Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing, 
   but this time using a while loop (call the array percentages3).

2. Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the while loop?

// I like the for loop better because it is more concise and easier to read.
